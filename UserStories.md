In reading my full list of stories, I realized I had more complexity in my MVP than needed. My core problem was laziness in RT'ing. That's the function I should build first, and that provides enough value to test with users. It's fully functional like rage and doesn't need the artist side to work.

Simpler => better.
I have to rewrite the fan stories below ain light of simpler structure.




Then make the artist side and these stories. 
As a fan:
- I want to read/learn about 1ktf before I sign up.
- I want to see all the artists I can support.
- I want to request that an artist approve me.
- I want to approve a request from an artist.
- I want to see a list of each artist I am supporting.
- I want to manage my list of supported artists.
- I want to see a list of all the RTs I've made on behalf of all artists.
-- on behalf of a shown artist.

As an artist:
- I want to see all the fans on my 1ktf list.
- I want to approve a fan's 1ktf request.
- I want to send a request to a fan.
- I want to see a fan's mentions and RTs of me.
-Follow-on tasks
-- I want to send a 1ktf tweet
-- I want to post a 1ktf G+ post
-- I want to post a 1ktf FB status


As a manager or PR rep:
- I want to add artists to 1ktf
- I want to see lists of all artist pending requests.
- I want to search "high-value followers" who already provide value by mentions and RTs
- I want to search "high-payoff followers" who have high impact among non-followers / are influencers among non-followers.
